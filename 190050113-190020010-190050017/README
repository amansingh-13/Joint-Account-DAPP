Following programs are required:

	geth v1.9.25 (included in tools)
	web3 (python package)
	py-solc-x (python package)

To run the smart contract follow these steps :

1. Starting a private ethereum chain :

	cd tools/
	./geth --datadir test-eth1 --password password.txt account new

Now copy the address gotten by running these commands to
the genesis.json in the alloc section that adds the eth
to the geth account.

	sh runEthereumNode.sh

2. Deploy the contract :
